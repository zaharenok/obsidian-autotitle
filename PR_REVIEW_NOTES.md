# Obsidian Releases PR Review Notes

This document captures the local checks performed for pull request [obsidianmd/obsidian-releases#8037](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/8037) and the items to monitor after submission.

_Last reviewed: 2024-07-08_

All locally verifiable requirements remain satisfied: the manifest and release metadata still align, the published assets are complete, and repository documentation/license files are unchanged from the validated state. No corrective action is needed on the plugin repository at this time.

## GitHub status snapshot
- ✅ Checks: the automated workflow on obsidianmd/obsidian-releases reports “All checks have passed” with the single required job succeeding.
- ❌ Mergeability: GitHub now reports merge conflicts against the latest `master`. The conflicts stem from other additions to `community-plugins.json` landing after this branch was created.

## Local validation summary
- **Manifest sanity** – `manifest.json` declares `id: "autotitle"`, `version: "1.0.1"`, and `minAppVersion: "0.15.0"`, matching the community entry that was added in the forked repository.
- **Release assets** – The GitHub release `1.0.1` currently ships the required distribution files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`) as individual assets.
- **Documentation** – `README.md` provides installation steps, configuration instructions, and usage guidance that satisfy the community plugin checklist.
- **License** – `LICENSE` file present in the repository root.

## GitHub follow-up checklist
- Confirm the release tag in `zaharenok/obsidian-autotitle` stays at **1.0.1** so that the validator sees a matching tag and manifest version.
- Ensure the PR body in obsidianmd/obsidian-releases keeps the community plugin template with all checkboxes marked.
- Wait for the automation (`plugin-ci` workflow) to finish successfully. Investigate any failures for manifest mismatches, missing assets, or formatting issues.
- Review bot comments (if any) for requests to adjust metadata or supply additional information.
- Monitor for human reviewer feedback and be prepared to update the release or README if changes are requested.

### Resolving the merge conflict
1. Pull the latest `master` from `obsidianmd/obsidian-releases` into the fork.
2. Reapply the `autotitle` entry at the end of `community-plugins.json`, making sure the array remains valid JSON with proper commas.
3. Run `npx prettier --write "**/community*.json"` (after `npm install`, if needed) to keep formatting consistent.
4. Commit the resolved file, push to `add-autotitle-plugin`, and re-run the GitHub checks.

## If validation fails
Should the validator or reviewers request changes, update the plugin repository (e.g., fix the manifest, refresh release assets, or bump the version), publish a new release tag, and re-run the PR checks by pushing the updated `community-plugins.json` entry if necessary.
