### Academic Note

**Input:**

```
The concept of neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize
itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. This remarkable
capacity allows the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to
adjust their activities in response to new situations or changes in their
environment.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "API Key Invalid" Error

- **Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and active
- **Check**: Ensure the key starts with `sk-` and has no extra spaces
- **Verify**: Log into OpenAI platform to confirm key status

#### "Insufficient Credits" Error

- **Solution**: Add credits to your OpenAI account
- **Check**: Visit [OpenAI Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
- **Note**: New accounts often include free credits

#### Titles in Wrong Language

- **Solution**: Set specific language instead of auto-detect
- **Tip**: Ensure your note has enough content for accurate detection
- **Alternative**: Try different AI models for better language handling

#### Auto-generation Not Working

- **Check**: Trigger mode is set to "Auto" or "Semi-auto"
- **Verify**: Content meets minimum length requirement
- **Adjust**: Increase timeout if generation happens too quickly
- **Test**: Try manual generation first to verify setup

#### Slow Generation

- **Solution**: Switch to GPT-4.1 nano or GPT-4o-mini for faster responses
- **Check**: Your internet connection stability
- **Consider**: OpenAI API response times vary by demand

### Performance Tips

1. **For Speed**: Use GPT-4.1 nano or GPT-4o-mini model
2. **For Quality**: Use GPT-4.1 or GPT-4o model
3. **For Cost**: Use GPT-4.1 nano or GPT-4o-mini
4. **For Latest Features**: Use GPT-4.1 family models
5. **For Accuracy**: Provide more context in your notes
6. **For Consistency**: Set specific language instead of auto-detect

## üîí Privacy & Security

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

Title generation costs depend on your chosen model:

- **GPT-4.1 nano**: ~$0.0001-0.0003 per title (most economical)
