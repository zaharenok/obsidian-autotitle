capacity allows the brain to compensate for injury and disease and to
adjust their activities in response to new situations or changes in their
environment.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "API Key Invalid" Error

- **Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and active
- **Check**: Ensure the key starts with `sk-` and has no extra spaces
- **Verify**: Log into OpenAI platform to confirm key status

#### "Insufficient Credits" Error

- **Solution**: Add credits to your OpenAI account
- **Check**: Visit [OpenAI Billing](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
- **Note**: New accounts often include free credits

#### Titles in Wrong Language

- **Solution**: Set specific language instead of auto-detect
- **Tip**: Ensure your note has enough content for accurate detection
- **Alternative**: Try different AI models for better language handling

#### Auto-generation Not Working

- **Check**: Trigger mode is set to "Auto" or "Semi-auto"
- **Verify**: Content meets minimum length requirement
- **Adjust**: Increase timeout if generation happens too quickly
- **Test**: Try manual generation first to verify setup

#### Slow Generation

- **Solution**: Switch to GPT-4.1 nano or GPT-4o-mini for faster responses
- **Check**: Your internet connection stability
- **Consider**: OpenAI API response times vary by demand

### Performance Tips

1. **For Speed**: Use GPT-4.1 nano or GPT-4o-mini model
2. **For Quality**: Use GPT-4.1 or GPT-4o model
3. **For Cost**: Use GPT-4.1 nano or GPT-4o-mini
4. **For Latest Features**: Use GPT-4.1 family models
